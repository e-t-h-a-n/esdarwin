# CF-1348.28

This is an alternative implementation of Apple's `CF` project. It was created from from [the sources released](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/tree/master/CoreFoundation) as part of [Apple's open-source Swift implementation](https://swift.org). The sources were collected and patched by `csekel` who also wrote the Xcode project file. Further sources were added by me, as well as more changes the code and project file.

The code contains [parts of Apple's open-source implementation of `CoreFoundation`, also called "CF", from their `Foundation` project](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/tree/master/CoreFoundation) for [the Swift Programming Language](https://swift.org) which is licensed under the Apache License (version 2).
